# NETS-213-Project
NETS 213 project by Ibrahim Fagbamila, Izzy Kim, Nick Ng, &amp; Susan Xie

## Major Project Components:
Building the website for users and workers to interact with (9 pts)
Key site features:
- Allow users to upload photos
- Allow workers to wait and receive alerts for jobs when photos are uploaded
- Allow workers to vote between photos
- Aggregate and process results
- Display results to users in a timely manner

Creating jobs on MTurk and determining payment system (2 pts)
- Allow workers to find our website via MTurk
- Identify workers when they visit our site so that we can pay them for waiting and tasks
- Pay them for their contributions through MTurk

Collecting Data (4 pts)
- Have people use our site and ensure sure that it's functional
- Get feedback from both users and workers on the interface
- Track key metrics (e.g out how often the worker vote influences the person, average response times, etc.)

Data Processing (5 pts)
- Determine how helpful aggregate opinions are (does the user agree or go with the worker opinions in the end?)
- Examine effect of worker confidence on user decision (if all the workers think the same, will that convince the user more?) 
- Determine how good individual worker predictions are of the final worker vote (are some workers more representative of the crowd?)
- Determine how good individual worker predictions are of the user decision (are some workers more influential?)
- Determine how long it takes to aggregate responses
- Compare performance to a non-human baseline (perhaps a trained CV model in A/B testing)
- Explore more questions with the data we collected

## Milestones:
### MS1
Start building the website where users can upload photos and workers can wait/vote on polls.
### MS2
Build aggregation system and improve UI. Post HITs on MTurk and start having people interact with the website so we can collect data.
### MS3
Process the data we collected and evaluate the performance of our system.
