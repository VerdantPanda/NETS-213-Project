# Second Opinion: Contribution Guide
NETS 213 project by Ibrahim Fagbamila, Izzy Kim, Nick Ng, &amp; Susan Xie

## How to Contribute To This Project:
### Project Description: 
Second Opinion provides users with a platform to crowdsource additional opinions,
specifically in regards to fashion. Have you ever been stuck while picking out an outfit? 
Your friends aren't responding to your messages? You can simply upload two images to 
our website, and our crowdworkers will quickly respond with which outfit they prefer. 

### Step-By-Step Guide: 
1. Click on "Submit Outfits" from the home screen
2. Upload two images, and select the speed you want for your responses: fast or immediate. Fast will get you results within a few minutes, whereas immediate will give you results within a minute.
3. Our workers will respond! 
4. Your results will be displayed in the form of a poll, showing percentage of workers who selected each image.
