# Second Opinion: Contribution Guide
NETS 213 project by Ibrahim Fagbamila, Izzy Kim, Nick Ng, &amp; Susan Xie

## How to Contribute To This Project:
### Project Description: 
Second Opinion provides users with a platform to crowdsource additional opinions,
specifically in regards to fashion. Have you ever been stuck while picking out an outfit? 
Your friends aren't responding to your messages? You can simply upload two images to 
our website, and our crowdworkers will quickly respond with which outfit they prefer. 

Our website is hosted at: https://second-opinion-nets213.herokuapp.com/

### Step-By-Step Guide: 
You can contribute as either a user or a worker!

As a user:
1. Click on "Submit Outfits" from the home screen
2. Upload two images, and select the speed you want for your responses: fast or immediate. Fast will get you results within a few minutes, whereas immediate will give you results within a minute.
3. Our workers will respond! (when the app is up and running with actual crowdworkers or students) 
4. Your results will be displayed in the form of a poll, showing percentage of workers who selected each image. 

As a worker:
1. Click "Review Outfits" from the home screen and input your worker ID.
2. As images are submitted to the site, they will appear in your feed.
3. When you see images appear, try to respond quickly indicating which one you like best and provide feedback as to why.
4. When you submit your feedback, the job will disappear until more users create more jobs.
